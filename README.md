## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 18+

### Install & Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

The dev server starts at `http://localhost:5173/`.
